    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>They're beautiful as breakfast or brunch fare, but we should heed the French tradition and use more eggs for dinner. 
            They're filling and quick to make. Serve with a fresh salad, bacon, cooked vegetables, a small bowl of soup, bread, biscuits, tortilla chips, smoky sausages, naan, or anything that suits your appetite. 
            Omelets are a fantastic choice that's also kid-friendly.
